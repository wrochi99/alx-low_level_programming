This folder in general contains scipts that deal with the intro to C as a programming language.

Script 0; touches on the preprocessing aspect i.e instructing the compiler to preprocess --
before compiling

Script 1; touches on the basic principle of compiling i.e converting pre-processed coded --
into assembly code

Script 2; touches on the basic principle of assembling i.e converting assembly code into --
object code

Script 3; touches on the principle of linking i.e combine object code of libraries in general --
and one's specific program object code

Program 4; program that prints desired statement with the 'puts' function

Program 5; program that prints desired statement with the 'printf' function

Program 6; program that prints sizes of some data types in a computer making use of --
'sizeof' and 'printf' statements after declaring variables

Script 7; script that touches on generating assembly code (using intel syntax) --
of a C code and saves it in an output file

Program 8; program that prints desired statement without using the 'printf' or --
'puts' functions, followed by a new line to standard error
